# Backend API for Role-Based Access Control and Approval Workflow

## Description
This backend repository is built with Node.js and Express, featuring a role-based access control system with an approval workflow for tasks. It also supports real-time data streaming and integration with MongoDB.

## Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Owner, Manager, and Employee roles with varying access levels.
- **Approval Workflow**: Task approvals by manager and/or owner, with priority given to owner approvals.
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Updates data instantly using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Supports pagination and filtering for large datasets.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT for authentication

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd backend


2. To add dependencies:: npm install

3. To Run The application : npm run dev

4. API Documentation

i. Authentication:
POST /api/login: Login and receive a JWT token.

ii. Approval Workflow:
POST /api/tasks: Create a new task (Owner and Manager only).
POST /api/tasks/:id/approve: Approve task (Manager or Owner).

iii. Real-Time Data:
Connect to WebSocket/SSE at /api/stream to receive real-time updates.




Backend (API) Structure: -

 1. Role-Based Access Control:
    Implement different access levels based on roles (Owner, Manager, Employee) using JWT.

1. Owners have full access. 
2. Managers have moderate access.
3. Employees have limited, read-only access.
   
2. Approval Workflow:
Implement a chain of approval where:
If an owner approves directly, no manager approval is needed.
If a manager approves, the request goes to the owner for final approval.

3. Real-Time Data Streaming:
Implement real-time data updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for tasks and approval statuses.

4. Database:
Connect to MongoDB to store and retrieve all data.
Support for fetching, filtering, and pagination of large datasets.

5. Deployment with GitHub Actions and Render:
Set up CI/CD pipeline to deploy the backend automatically on Render upon pushing changes to GitHub.

6. Optimizations:
Implement lazy loading, code splitting, component-level caching, and efficient data handling strategies like pagination.
